### Welcome to the NEAR Branch
Hey there, welcome to our NEAR branch! Here, we're diving into NEAR's nPoS consensus mechanism and Quadratic Sharding to calculate carbon emissions of individual NEAR addresses. We're piecing together this puzzle.

NEAR's gas fees don't flow straight to validators. Can we work out transaction-based methods, either top-down or bottom-up? Nevertheless, many more aspects needs to be taken into account as there are no one-size-fits-all formula.

### Insight Sources
NEAR explorer's public database: "postgres://public_readonly:nearprotocol@mainnet.db.explorer.indexer.near.dev/mainnet_explorer"
NEAR RPC API
Indexing services like subgraph are on our radar.

### Challenges
Time crunches and data availability are real hurdles.
